# taskwarrior-tools
Collection of scripts too small to have their own repo.

The bigger (and probably more interesting) taskwarrior tools:
- [tasksched](https://github.com/AnotherKamila/tasksched): An opinionated Taskwarrior web UI. Great for scheduling when to do your tasks.

What is in here:

- `timew2ctt`: Timewarrior extension to export Timewarrior data to [ctt](https://www.nico.schottelius.org/software/ctt/)
